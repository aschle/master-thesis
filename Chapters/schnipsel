[TODO: Systematization - Studies using network science approaches (network properties, measures and community detection) to investigate social behaviour of eighter (A) bees or (C) social insects with data derived from (X) automatic tracking methods or (long term, temporal analysis) (Y) manual tracking methods; list of studies for AY, BY and BX (short term, static), those are available, but not for AX, only one study but not investigating networks]\\

[Summarize works important for my work: Mersch, Barachi, ... (only take 3 or 4)]\\

[TODO: Table all studies and limitations: year, author, animal,  observation period (static, temporal), resolution, number of colonies, colony size, marked/observed individuals, did they consider age of animals, space limitations, \textbf{maybe put in appendix as reference???}]\\

[TODO: Table all studies and information related to networks: network type (spatial, contact, food exchange), (un-)weighted, (un-)directed, if spatial proximity what definition, if weighted what weights, temporal or static, if temporal time-aggregated or time-ordered, \textbf{Ich schätze dieser Teil muss woanders hin.}]\\

Look at \cite{quevillon2015social} for static network analysis stuff they measured (ants, only small amount with observed interaction using 20 Minute videos).

Structure of the social network and its influence on transmission dynamics in a honeybee colony

In \emph{Social Insects: A Model System for Network Dynamics}~\cite{charbonneau2013social} a good overview is given about Role and Types of Networks in Social Insects.

Thus, I need to implement a pipeline to extract networks out of the given data set. Furthermore, I want to find out if the resulting networks are suitable for social network analysis.

The structure of my applied approach in the consideration and processing of the data of the honeybees is comprehensively illustrated in Fig. 4.1.

In the first step, the date set was analyzed regarding data quality... 


Colony size was
defined as the number of individuals in a colony on a given
day and since it varied slightly across the duration of the
observation period due to the birth and death of individuals,
number of interactions and number of interaction partners
for each individual were normalized for the total number of
interactions and the total number of available partners,
respectively, on each day.

``In other words, all members of a community must be reached through other members of the same community (connectedness). At the same time we expect that nodes that belong to a community have a higher probability to link to the other members of that community than to nodes that do not belong to the same community (density). While this hypothesis considerably narrows what would be considered a community, it does not uniquely define it.''~\cite[p.~X]{barabasi2016network}


\paragraph*{Disparity}
\url{https://github.com/aekpalakorn/python-backbone-network}
Low values of disparity indicated that the weights of associations were of the same order and, consequently, that ants interacted homogeneously with all nestmates. In contrast, privileged associations between ants were evidenced by relatively large values of disparity showing the dominance of a few weights over the others.~\cite{barthelemy2005characterization}

Disparity: For a given node i   with connectivity  ki  and strength  si  different situations can arise. All weights  wij  can be of the same order  si/ki . In contrast, the most heterogeneous situation is obtained when one weight dominates over all the others. A simple way to measure this “disparity” is given by the quantity  Y2  introduced in other context [12] ;  [13];

$$Y_2(i)=\sum_{j\in \Theta(i)} (\frac{w_ij}{s_i})^2$$
