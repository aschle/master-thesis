``In other words, all members of a community must be reached through other members of the same community (connectedness). At the same time we expect that nodes that belong to a community have a higher probability to link to the other members of that community than to nodes that do not belong to the same community (density). While this hypothesis considerably narrows what would be considered a community, it does not uniquely define it.''~\cite[p.~X]{barabasi2016network}


\paragraph*{Disparity}
\url{https://github.com/aekpalakorn/python-backbone-network}
Low values of disparity indicated that the weights of associations were of the same order and, consequently, that ants interacted homogeneously with all nestmates. In contrast, privileged associations between ants were evidenced by relatively large values of disparity showing the dominance of a few weights over the others.~\cite{barthelemy2005characterization}

Disparity: For a given node i   with connectivity  ki  and strength  si  different situations can arise. All weights  wij  can be of the same order  si/ki . In contrast, the most heterogeneous situation is obtained when one weight dominates over all the others. A simple way to measure this “disparity” is given by the quantity  Y2  introduced in other context [12] ;  [13];

$$Y_2(i)=\sum_{j\in \Theta(i)} (\frac{w_ij}{s_i})^2$$
