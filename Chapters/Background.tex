\section{Animal Interaction Networks}

Networks where individuals are nodes and edges are defined as interaction events between individuals are called \emph{interaction networks}, sometimes also contact networks. 
Those interactions used as an edge can be of different types~\cite{charbonneau2013social}:

\begin{itemize}
\item spatial proximity~\cite{jeanson2012long, otterstatter2007contact},
\item physical contact (usually with antennae, “antennation”)~\cite{mersch2013tracking} [TODO anschauen: 10, 67, 80]
\item a food exchange event (trophallaxis) [TODO anschauen: 15, 68, 69, 93]
\item or specific communication signals [TODO anschauen: 38, 56]
\end{itemize}

directed and undirected\\
weighted and unweighted\\
