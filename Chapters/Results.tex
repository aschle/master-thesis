This chapter summarizes the analysis results of the temporal, spatial proximity network of honey bees, consisting of three consecutive time-aggregated snapshots.\\
The first section describes my results related to static aspects of the networks on three levels.
First I examine the networks' global structure and derive properties of the overall colony (global level). Second I study the characteristics of individual bees (local level), and it's relation to detection frequency and age.
Additionally, I investigate the intermediate level of the colonies social organization by detecting communities and inspecting their practical meaning.\\
The second section focuses on the temporal network aspects of all three snapshots.
I investigate the stability of local and global properties, as well as the stability of functional groups of bees concerning age and spatial distribution. Furthermore, the dynamics of individual bees regarding their group membership over time is examined.
The last section of this chapter summarizes the main results and discusses the findings.
