This chapter summarizes the analysis results of the temporal, spatial proximity network of honey bees, consisting of three consecutive time-aggregated snapshots.\\
The first section describes results related to static aspects of one snapshot~3.
I investigate the snapshot on three levels. First I examined the networks global structure and derived properties of the overall colony (global level). Second I studied the characteristics of individual bees (local level), and its relation to detection frequency and age.
Additionally, I investigated the intermediate level of the colonies social organization by detecting communities and inspecting their practical meaning.\\
The second section focuses on the temporal network aspects of all three snapshots.
I investigated the stability of local and global properties, as well as the stability of functional groups of bees concerning age and spatial distribution. Furthermore, the dynamics of individual bees regarding their group membership over time is examined.
The last section fo this chapter summarizes the main results and discusses the findings.
