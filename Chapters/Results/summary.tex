\section{Discussion of Results}

summary of result in relation to goals (static part)\\
(2)\\
goal kind of worker-worker interaction networks emerge\\
structure\\
topology\\
characteristic properties\\
different from random\\
global/local, colony/ population, bee/individual\\

(3)\\
meaningful community structure\\
how are communities charcterized\\
do they reflect known colony behaviour concerning age and spatial distribution?\\

summary of results in relation to goals (temporal part)\\
(4)\\
how do communities develop over time\\
stable regarding their properties\\
how do members move\\




stable global structure over time\\
degree dist, centrality and so on stays the same over the three snapshots\\
dynamic local structure (node level, individual bee)\\
bees change communities as they age\\
conclusion: verifies my definition of the networks and chosen parameters\\
