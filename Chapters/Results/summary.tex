\section{Discussion of Results}

stable global structure over time\\
degree dist, centrality and so on stays the same over the three snapshots\\
dynamic local structure (node level, individual bee)\\
bees change communities as they age\\
conclusion: verifies my definition of the networks and chosen parameters\\
