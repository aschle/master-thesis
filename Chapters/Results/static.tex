1) Global level: colony/population\\
2) Intermediat level: communities\\
3) Local level: individual bee\\

I analyzed a temporal network, consisting of three time-aggregated snapshots; these are referred to below as snapshot~1~($N=922$), snapshot~2~($N=978$) and snapshot~3~($N=922$). 
The snapshots are aggregated for ten hours (108,000 frames) starting at 8~a.m. and lasting until 6~p.m, see table~\ref{tab:networks} for details about the added bees per day,  figure~\ref{fig:ages} for the age distributions. Figure~\ref{fig:network-matching} shows the proportion of intersecting bees between each snapshot. This figure illustrates the stability of the network concerning its size.
