\section{Static Perspectives of Honey Bee Networks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The networks are examined on three levels.
First, I examine the network's global structure and derive properties of the overall colony (global level).
Next, I study the characteristics of individual bees (local level) and the relation of the characteristics to detection frequency and age.
Finally, I investigate the intermediate level of the colonies social organization by detecting communities and inspecting their practical meaning.
I analyzed a temporal network, consisting of three time-aggregated snapshots; these are referred to below as snapshot~1~($N = 922$), snapshot~2~($N = 978$) and snapshot~3~($N = 922$).
The snapshots are aggregated for ten hours ($108,000$~frames) starting at 8~a.m. and lasting until 6~p.m.
See Table~\ref{tab:networks} for details about the bees added each day. Figure~\ref{fig:network-matching} shows the proportion of intersecting bees between consecutive snapshots.
This figure illustrates the stability of the network size.

	Each column represents a time step, the \emph{dark gray} rectangles represent the snapshot for each step, and the height of the rectangles corresponds to the amount of members, as referenced by the number.
	The \emph{light gray} boxes represent the number of bees that are added to the colony and bees that disappear.
	This figure shows the amount of bees for each snapshot and the proportion of intersection.}
