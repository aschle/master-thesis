\section{Static Analysis}

I analyzed a temporal network, consisting of three time-aggregated snapshots; these are referred to below as snapshot~1~($N=922$), snapshot~2~($N=978$) and snapshot~3~($N=922$). 
The snapshots are aggregated for ten hours (108,000 frames) starting at 8~a.m. and lasting until 6~p.m, see table~\ref{tab:networks} for details about the added bees per day,  figure~\ref{fig:ages} for the age distributions. Figure~\ref{fig:network-matching} shows the proportion of intersecting bees between each snapshot. This figure illustrates the stability of the network concerning its size.

	\label{fig:network-matching}
\end{figure}

Each snapshot consists of one large component.
Table~\ref{tab:stats} summarizes basic network properties.
For all, the density $D$ is over 50\%.
The diameter $\langle d_{\texttt{max}} \rangle$ is three and the average shortest path length $\langle d \rangle$ is below two.
The global clustering coefficient $C_\Delta$ of all snapshots is higher than compared to an Erdös-Renyi random graph, averaged over 100 runs using the same number of nodes and edges.
The high clustering coefficient and the small diameter suggest a small-world network type.
On average, each bee is connected to at least 50\% of all other bees in the network.

Figure~\ref{fig:fVSd} shows a positive correlation between the frequency of interactions and the total duration of interactions (averaged).
The frequency of interactions is used as weight of edges.
The edge weight distribution is shown in figure~\ref{fig:edgeWdist}.
Most edges have a low weight, only a few edges have a high weight.
It seems that bees do not prefer individuals bees for interaction.
