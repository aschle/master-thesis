\section{Static Perspectives of Honey Bee Networks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The networks are examindes on the levels.
First of all I examine the networks' global structure and derive properties of the overall colony (global level). Second I study the characteristics of individual bees (local level), and it's relation to detection frequency and age.
Additionally, I investigate the intermediate level of the colonies social organization by detecting communities and inspecting their practical meaning.\\

I analyzed a temporal network, consisting of three time-aggregated snapshots; these are referred to below as snapshot~1~($N=922$), snapshot~2~($N=978$) and snapshot~3~($N=922$). 
The snapshots are aggregated for ten hours (108,000 frames) starting at 8~a.m. and lasting until 6~p.m, see table~\ref{tab:networks} for details about the added bees per day. Figure~\ref{fig:network-matching} shows the proportion of intersecting bees between consecutive snapshot. This figure illustrates the stability of the network concerning its size.
