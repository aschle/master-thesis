The leading eigenvector~(LE) community detection algorithms revealed two communities with a similar size~(modularity score of~$0.25$).
The walktrap algorithm~(WT) discovered three communities instead, also evenly distributed~(modularity score of~$0.23$).~Table~\ref{tab:n3-communities} lists the precise number of members per community and algorithm for snapshot~3.

For both algorithms the communities correspond to different age groups.
For LE, the average age of the young community is~$13.2$~days and the average age of  the old community is~$28.7$~days.
For WT, the average age of the young community is~$6.6$~days and~$29.3$~days for the older commmunity.
The average age of the third middle-aged community of WT is~$25.1$~days.
The age distribution for each algorithm is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:n3ageLE} and~\ref{fig:n3ageWT}.
The two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed that the age distributions per community are significantly different.
The corresponding $p$-values are listed in Table~\ref{tab:n3-pvalues2}.

Each community occupies a different region of the comb.
Figure~\ref{fig:n3-communities} shows that the young communities spend the most time in the comb center and the old communities closer to the hive exit. The middle-aged community is positioned between the young and old community and in the periphery of the comb.
