The leading eigenvector community detection algorithms revealed two communities, about the same size, the walktrap algorithm instead three communities (see table~\ref{tab:n3-communities}).
The communities correspond to separate age groups and are located in different regions on the comb (see figure~\ref{fig:n3-communities}). The younger communities are situated in the center and the old communities closer to the hive exit. The middle-aged community (only for walktrap) is located between and on the periphery. Table~\ref{tab:n3-pvalues2} shows the $p$-values for the two sampel KS-test.
