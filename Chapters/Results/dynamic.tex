\section{Temporal Perspectives of Honey Bee Networks}

For all three snapshots, the same exponentially decay regarding the edge weights can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:statEdgeWeightDist}.
The analysis of snapshot~1 and 2 showed that the same characteristic distribution of degree, strength, lcc, betweenness, and closeness for snapshot~1~\ref{fig:n1-degreeStrLCC} and snapshot~2~\ref{fig:n2-degreeStrLCC} exists. They also follow a normal distribution and the characteristic bimodality is shown. The correlation between the local measure and detection frequency and age remains.
This shows that the characteristics described in section~\ref{subsubsec:bees} applies for all three snapshots and is, therefore, stable for this investigated time interval. A low hierarchical structure and the correlation with age and detection frequency seem to be a global property of the colony.

\subsection{Stability of Functional Groups}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table~\ref{tab:communities} lists the exact number of bees per community for each algorithm and snapshot.
For each snapshot, the leading eigenvector detected two communities with about the same number of bees.
The first communities CY(1,2,3) contain the queen and on average younger bees than the second communities CO(1,2,3).\\
In comparison, walktrap identified three communities, but two for the first snapshot.
Again the first communities CY(1,2,3) consist of the queen and on average younger bees than the second CM(2,3) and third communities CO(1,2,3).
The bees in CM2 and CM3 are on average younger than the bees in CO2 and CO3.
Figure~\ref{fig:ageDistribution} depicts the age distribution for each community and snapshot.

A two-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test showed that the age distributions are significantly different ($p< 0.001$) for both algorithms. However, the $p$-values for the walktrap communities CM2, CO2, and CM3, CO3 are lower.
The spatial segregation of the communities is very similar in all three snapshots. For further reference see the heat maps in~\ref{fig:communitiesPerNetworkWT} and~\ref{fig:communitiesPerNetworkLE}.
The detected communities seem to differ in their respective age and occupy different areas of the comb, but remain stable over this inpected time interval.

\subsection{Dynamic of Individual Bees}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Figure~\ref{fig:membersLE} (LE) and figure~\ref{fig:membersWT} (WT) show the flow of bees between consecutive snapshots and communities.
For leading eigenvector communities, the majority of bees stay in their age group, and a small fraction of bees switches to older communities.
Only a few bees change to younger communities.
The new middle-aged communities CM2 and CM3, detected by walktrap, consist partly of young (CY1) and old (CO1) bees. The switching behavior of individuals between communities is similar to leading eigenvector.
Individual bees change communities as they age.

	Each column represents a time step, the colored rectangles represent the communities for each step, and the height of the rectangles corresponds to the number of its community members, as referenced by the number. \emph{Green} indicates the community containing young bees and the queen, \emph{gray} represents the community containing middle-aged bees (only for WT), and \emph{orange} the community containing old bees. This figure shows that the major part of the bees either stays in the same aged community or switch to an older group.}
