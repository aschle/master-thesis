Each snapshot consists of one large component.
Table~\ref{tab:stats} summarizes basic network properties.
For all, the density $D$ is over 50\%.
The diameter $\langle d_{\texttt{max}} \rangle$ is three and the average shortest path length $\langle d \rangle$ is below two.
The global clustering coefficient $C_\Delta$ of all snapshots is higher than compared to an Erd√∂s-Renyi random graph, averaged over 100 runs using the same number of nodes and edges.
The high clustering coefficient and the small diameter suggest a small-world network type.
On average, each bee is connected to at least 50\% of all other bees in the network.

Figure~\ref{fig:fVSd} shows a positive correlation between the frequency of interactions and the total duration of interactions (averaged).
 The weight of edges is the frequency of interactions.
The edge weight distribution is shown in figure~\ref{fig:edgeWdist}.
Most edges have a low weight; only a few edges have a high weight.
It seems that bees do not prefer individuals bees for interaction.

Figure~\ref{fig:n3ageDist} shows the age distribution of the investigated snapshot. This distribution does not seem to follow any known distribution. It corresponds to the artificial tagging of bees. Consequently, bees of certain age groups are simply not present. The detection frequency of an individual bee is negatively correlated with its age (figure~\ref{fig:n3detfVSage}).
