\subsection{Properties of the Bee Colony}
\label{subsec:colony}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each snapshot consists of one component.
The density $D$ is over~50\% for all snapshots (69\%; 54\%; 61\%).
The diameter $\langle d_{\texttt{max}} \rangle$ is~$3$ and the average shortest path length $\langle d \rangle$ is between~$1$ and~$2$.
The global clustering coefficient~(gcc) $c_\Delta$ of all snapshots is higher than compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph, averaged over~100 runs using the same number of nodes and links.
On average, each bee is connected to at least~50\% of the colony~(68\%; 52\%; 61\%).
During the ten-hour observation period, a bee interacts over 4,000 times~(5,680; 3,978; 4,206) on average.
Table~\ref{tab:stats} summarizes the basic network properties for each snapshot and lists the values of its corresponding random graph.

For further analysis, I select snapshot~3 because no young bees were added to the colony during that day and, unlike snapshot~1, bees below the age of five days were part of the colony~(Figure~\ref{fig:agesAll}).
Figure~\ref{fig:n3ageDist} shows the age distribution of snapshot~3.
This distribution corresponds to the artificial tagging of the bees.
Consequently, bees of certain age groups are simply not present.
The detection frequency of an individual bee is negatively correlated with its age~(Figure~\ref{fig:n3detfVSage}).
The link weight distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:edgeWdist}.
Most links have a low weight; only a few links have a high weight.
The logarithmized frequency distribution of the link weights appears to be an exponential decay function with an exponent of 0.015. The fitted plot is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:123edgeslog}.
