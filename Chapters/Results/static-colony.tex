\subsection{Properties of the Bee Colony}
\label{subsec:colony}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each snapshot consists of one component.
The density $D$ is over 50\% for all snapshots (69\%; 54\%; 61\%).
The diameter $\langle d_{\texttt{max}} \rangle$ is $3$ and the average shortest path length $\langle d \rangle$ is inbetween $1$ and $2$.
The global clustering coefficient $C_\Delta$ of all snapshots is higher than compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}niy random graph, averaged over 100 runs using the same number of nodes and edges.
On average, each bee is connected to at least 50\% of the colony (68\%; 52\%; 61\%). During the ten hour observation peroid a bee interacts on average over $4,000$ times ($5,680$; $3,978$; $4,206$)
Table~\ref{tab:stats} summarizes those basic network properties for each snapshot and lists the values of its corresponding random graph.


Figure~\ref{fig:n3ageDist} shows the age distribution of the further investigated snapshot 3. This distribution corresponds to the artificial tagging of the bees. Consequently, bees of certain age groups are simply not present. The detection frequency of an individual bee is negatively correlated with its age (figure~\ref{fig:n3detfVSage}).

The edge weight distribution is shown in figure~\ref{fig:edgeWdist}.
Most edges have a low weight; only a few edges have a high weight.
It seems that bees do not prefer individuals bees for interaction.[TODO. figure out what it means.]
