\chapter{Approach and Implementation}
\label{ch:approach}
In this chapter the basic work flow is described in detail. The process is mainly drive by an exploratory approach, but follows primarily Farines and Whiteheads~\cite{farine2015constructing} primary steps and key considerations for social network analysis to non-human animal data. The adapted and resulting process is visualized in figure~\ref{fig:process}.

The dataset was first analysed regarding data quality and to form an understanding of the dataset and behaviour of bees in general. Those findings were used to define nodes and infer associations to build the network, respectively derive parameters for the network pipeline. The static and temporal networks are analysed using network scienc tools and methods (e.g. TODO). For testing hypothesis the networks are combined with attributed data (spatial and age information). Each step is explained within the following sections.

\section{The Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
The basis of the dataset are video files, that capture tagged honey bees of one colony in a two sided observation hive.
Each individual of the colony, including about 3200 bees, were tagged with 12-bit markers. Four cameras were used to film the hive, the setup of the cameras is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:cams} and an example of tagged bees is shown in figure~\ref{fig:markers}.

The recording season lastet nine weeks (63 days), around the clock, from 19.07.2016 until 19.09.2016, with some interruptions due to maintainance and technical failures, this is shown in figure~\ref{fig:period}. Those days were excluded completely.
The recording resolution of each camera is three frames per second, aiming for $1024$ frames (about $5.7$ minutes) for a video files.For each frame, bee detections were extracted by using an image analysis pipeline.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/setupCams}
	\caption{Camera Setup in 2016: (1) Top View:  vertical hive with two cameras for each side, overlapping in the middle. (2) Front View: left and right camera setup, the red dot indicated the origin $(0,0)$ of the camera.}
	\label{fig:cams}
\end{figure}

The resulting detection data is stored in a binary file format. A python library called \emph{bb-binary}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BioroboticsLab/bb_binary}; Last accesed: 2106-02-16, 04:28PM} provides easy access to the binary files. Each file in bb\_binary file format corresponds to a video file of a single camera.
The size of the complete dataset for 2016 is $470$~GB, about $7.5$~GB of binary data per day.

Exactly $3.191$ bees were tagged. The tagging period is 67 days long. The tagging started on 2016-06-28 (22 days before the recording started) and lasted until 2016-09-02 (17 days before the recording ended). The young bees were tagged and then added to the hive, about noon each day. The overall tagging frequency is shown in figure~\ref{fig:tagging}. The hatching day for each bee is known, therefore the age of each bee.

This is calculated using the expected number of files produced by each camera per hour.}

On average 48 bees were tagged each day, considering only tagging days, the average is about 91 ($\pm50$) bees (median 118, mode 128).}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Structure of the Dataset}
The data is organised in \emph{frame container}, wich corresponds to a video file of a single camera. A frame container holds all \emph{frames} for that specific video.
Each frame has a list of all bees detected by the image analysis pipeline.

A \emph{detection} has the following attributes, which are relevant to this project:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{xpos}: $x$ coordinate of bee with respect to the image in pixel
\item \textbf{ypos}: $y$ coordinate of bee with respect to the image in pixel
\item \textbf{radius}: of the tag
\item \textbf{decodedId}: decoded 12-bit id, the bit probabilities are discretised to 0-255
\end{itemize}

Besides further information, the frame container specifies the camera and a frame is also attributed with a timestamp. The data can be accessed iterating on frame container or on frame level, in both cases using timestamps for start and end. The data scheme is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:scheme}.
The complete data scheme can be found on github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BioroboticsLab/bb_binary/blob/master/bb_binary/bb_binary_schema.capnp}; Last accessed: 2106-02-16, 04:46PM}. 


\subsection{Data Quality and ID Confidence}
\label{subsec:confidence}

Each bit of the decoded 12-bit ID represents a probability between $0$ and $255$. That means when using a high ID confidence\footnote{The confidence of an ID is calculated as follows. TODO. Each bit should be over the confidance value.} results in less data, but with a higher accuracy.
A low confidence results more data, but rather uncertaity and a higher error. A good tradeoff between data quality and amount of data should be chosen. Figure~\ref{fig:tradeoff} shows the proportion of wrong detections (as a fraction of all data) depending on the confidence level for all four cameras.

A confidence level of $0.95$ results in about $59\%$ of remaining data, of those about $6\%$ are wrong detections. This level of confidence is chosen.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/tradeoff}
	\caption[Tradeoff: Confidence level, data quality and amount of data]{On 21.07.2016, about half of the bee tags were used up. This day was chosen to determine the effects of the ID confidence level on data quality and amount of remaining data. For each camera a five minute test dataset was chosen (15:00-15:5). For a sample ($n= 100.000$) of remaining detection, the age was determined, negative ages were counted as wrong detections (times two).}
	\label{fig:tradeoff}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Influence of ID Confidence on Tracking Fragmentation}
\label{subsec:tracking}

Not only has the ID confidence an effect on the amount of remaining data and its quality (number of wrong detections), as a consequence also on the fragmentation of bee tracks. Bee tracks are sequences of zero and ones indicating the absence and presence of bees over a specified time period.

The average total amount of absence time (zeros) per bee, is slightly decreasing with an increasing confidence level, because errors are filtered out (low number of 1 and the rest zeroes). The average number of fragments is increasing with an higher confidence level. That means also that the number of gaps of zeroes of different sizes (e.g. 1,2,3) is increasing with a higher confidence level as well.

\end{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/gaps}
	\caption[Average Number of Gaps]{Gaps: The higher the confidence level the higher the number of gaps of size 1, 2, and 3.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Statistical Description of the Dataset}
i will fill this part, when I need it\\
speed of bees\\
presence and absence of bees (counted and as duration)\\
presence and absence of bee-pairs (counted and as duration)\\
number of detected bees per day (and hour)\\ 
not sure if so much is needed\\
will see later\\


\subsection{Implications}
only some days can be used for creating the networks , due to technical problems\\
confidence $95\%$\\
the absence of bees can have a lot of reasons, beeing inside a cell, outside the hive, ID quality to bad (confidence), not detected by camera because inside the exit, backwards on the window pane, difficult angle of tag, coverd by another bee, and so on an ond.\\
Therefore the detection of bees, who are close to each other (who are likely to interact), should be not that strict, or at least variable. This has to be taken into acoount, when looking at spatialy close bees.\\


\section{Inferring Networks}

The following part describes the pipeline for generating spatial proximity networks out of honey bee tracking data. A node in the network is a bee. They are distinguished by IDs. Only bees are in the network who interact with other bees, that means they have at least one edge (degree of one).


Two bees are associated (spatially close to each other), if they have a \emph{maximum distance} of $d$ (how $d$ is chosen is explained later on). This criteria is very week, meaning having a resolution of three frames per seconds results in interactions which could only last for $0.33$ seconds. So an additional parameter \emph{minimum contact duration} $t$ is introduced, the minimum time they have to spend nearby (at least) to be called associated.


Taking the fragmentation of tracks into account, it is obvious that two bees could be nearby but not at the very same time, but slightly shifted. So the minimum contact duration would be too errow prone. To overcome this issue one could correct the bee tracks, by filling 0-gaps of varius sizes and interpolating the position of that bee accordingly. This is rather time consuming for this amount of tracking data. And also considering, that at the moment the tracking data is going to be improved anyway, then manipulating the raw data seems senseless. I rather perform a gap filling (correction) on the time series of pairs, but not on the bee tracks, because this can be done anyways/independantely.


To evaluate this method I compared the hemming distance of binary strings for resulting pairs for (1) Correcting Bee Tracks (fill gaps size one), then extract pairs, (2) Bee tracks without correction, then extract pairs and (3) Bee Tracks without correction, but corrected extracted pairs (fill gaps size one).\\

The parameter is called \emph{gap size} $g$.

\subsection{Network Pipeline}

The network pipeline takes as input a path to an bb\_binary repository and outputs a graph in graphML file format. All cameras are included in the pipeline. The pipeline uses the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item $d$ in px - maximum distance of bees (spatial proximity)
\item $t$ in frames - minimum contact duration (how many frames they need to spend nearby to count as association)
\item $gap$ in frames - size of gap, which is used to corret bee pair time series
\item $window$ in minutes - size of time window for aggregating the network
\end{itemize}

Other parameters are:

\begin{itemize}
\item path to data
\item id confidence
\item 2016 or 2015 - method for calculating beeIDs
\item start timestamp - start of network slice
\item number of used CPUs for parallelization
\item file name prefix - for gaphML file
\end{itemize}

The pipeline is parallelized on frame level, that means, each process gets a portion of the data, extracts interactions, the main process, adds everything up and creates the network. The steps are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each camera: filter detections by ID confidence (according to 2016/2015)
\item Simple stitching of the two sides of the hive.
\item Extract close pairs with param $d$.
\item Correct pair time series with gap size parameter $gap$.
\item Extract interactions from time series with parameter $t$.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Thresholding Edges}
Edges with weight=one are removed, maybe just an error and not that important.

\subsection{Pipeline Parameters}
confidence 0.95, becasue of~\ref{subsec:confidence}\\

distance is XXX px, because average length of bee is XXX, analog zu paper von Barachi(?) when they were at a distance minor of the length of a bee body~\cite{baracchi2014socio} (measurement: 4 Images one for each cameras, measured length with imageJ manually)\\

minimum contact duration X, because Y, damit man nicht so viele Vorbeiäufe dabei hat\\

\section{Static and Temporal Analysis}
what dataset is used here?\\
TODO\\

\subsection{Static Network Analysis}
The following network properties were analysed for a static day network.
TODO: list of properties. (similar to what others have done)

\subsection{Temporal Analysis}
consecutive day networks\\
one day split up in hours\\

\section{Attributed Data and Hypothesis Testing}
Hypothesis\\
(1) Communities reflect groups of bees working in different areas of the hive and\\ (2) Communities relect different age groups\\

The data which was used to test the hypothesis (1) is saved in a sqlite database for faster access, because using bb\_binary (parsing the data over and over again) was to slow. For testing if lists of positions are different the test XY was used.

For hypothesis (2) the data is stored as csv of birth dates of a bee. For testing if age goups are different the Kolmogorov Smirnov Test was used.

\section{Implementation, Runtime and Complexity}
For implementing the network pipeline python, with pandas and numpy, are used, because the bb\_binary library, for accessing the tracking, data is only available in python. The networks, in graphML format, are created using the python library \emph{NetworkX}\footnote{\url{https://networkx.github.io/} ; Last accessed: 2017-02-17, 08:07PM} in version 1.11.
iGraph for community detection\\
some bash scrips for generating multiple networks\\

bottleneck is reading bb\_binary data into pandas dataframes\\
using multithreading for distribution on frame level (a process gets X frames for processing)\\

maybe some table with how long nees what with how many cores\\
