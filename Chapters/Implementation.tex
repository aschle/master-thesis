This chapter describes the workflow and implementation I applied to reach my research goals.
The preparation and processing of the data are primarily driven by a combination of exploratory and iterative processes.

I primarily follow  Farine's and Whitehead's~\cite{farine2015constructing} steps and key considerations for social network analysis to non-human animal data.
[TODO: steps kurz zusammenfassen, und unterschiede zu mir erklären]
Figure~\ref{fig:process} visualizes the adapted and resulting process.
[TODO: Schritte im Bild nummerieren und im Text verwenden]

In the first step, the data set was analyzed to form a general understanding of the given dataset, its structure, quality, and characteristics.

The results of this investigation are used to define nodes and infer associations to build the network, respectively derive the parameters for the network pipeline.

The resulting networks are analyzed by using network science tools and methods.
[hier unbedingt methoden aufzählen]																																																																																																						

[TODO: umfomulieren, Begruendun Auswahl der Attribute, und welche Test habe ich genau gemacht.]
For testing underlying hypothesis the networks are attributed with the bees spatial information and their age.
