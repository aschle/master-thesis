This chapter describes the basic workflow. The process is mainly driven by an exploratory data analysis approach but primarily follows  Farine's and Whitehead's~\cite{farine2015constructing} steps and key considerations for social network analysis to non-human animal data. Figure~\ref{fig:process} visualizes the adapted and resulting process.

The data set was first analyzed regarding data quality and to form an understanding of the dataset and the behavior of bees in general. Those findings were used to define nodes and infer associations to build the network, respectively derive the parameters for the network pipeline. The resulting networks are analyzed using network science tools and methods. For testing underlying hypothesis the networks are attributed with the bees spatial information and their age. The following sections explain each step in detail.
