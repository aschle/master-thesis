This chapter describes the workflow and implementation I applied to reach my research goals. 
In the first section, I describe the given data set and the approach to infer networks.
This first step of network interference, was primarily driven by a combination of an exploratory data analysis and an iterative pipeline development process.
It serves as a prerequisite for network analysis part of this thesis.
The second section explains the methods I used to analyze the resulting networks regarding network properties, communities, and its development.

To yield the first set of functional and non-functional requirements concerning the pipeline, I conducted a data analysis of the given tracking data, and a literature review, already mentioned in section~\ref{ch:relatedwork}.
The data analysis supported the forming of a general understanding of the given dataset, its structure, characteristics and estimation of its quality.
The purpose of the review was to get an overview of the common methods and approaches regarding network analysis in this field of research.
Both results are then used to decide for a network type and its definition of nodes and edges.
Furthermore, I inferred specific pipeline parameters and decided for the procedure of network extraction.


This pipeline was developed, tested and then refined in an iterative process.
Accordingly, the results of the evaluation lead to new or changing functional requirements.
The evaluation is conducted by reviewing the pipeline parameters' effects on network properties and checking the validity and quality of the networks by investigating the age of bees in the resulting network.
