In this chapter, I outline the methodology I applied to reach my research goals. 
In the first section, I describe the data and the experimental setup.
In the second section, I share my findings concerning data quality and the steps needed to obtain a reliable dataset.
Then I describe my approach to infer networks.
The last section explains the methods I used to analyze the properties, communities, and development of the resulting networks.
