\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{ch:conclusion}
1. - stable global structure of the colony over time\\
a) stable network properties: distribution of network measures (degree, strength, lcc, $C_B$ and $C_C$ stays the same over the three snapshots\\
b) communities stay the same over the snapshots (age groups, spatial groups)

2. - dynamic local structure (node level, individual bee): bees change communities as they age\\

as expected from honey bee colonies, confirms research results of others\\
verifies my definition of the networks (network pipeline) and chosen network parameters, validates the first goal: inferrence of temporal networks\\
