The purpose of this thesis was to implement a pipeline for the extraction of time-aggregated networks using the provided high-resolution honey bee tracking data.
Moreover, the resulting weighted undirected spatial proximity networks of three consecutive time steps were analyzed regarding their network topology, community structures and the development of community members, to investigate the characteristics of honey bee colonies.

As opposed to most real world networks, these honey bee interaction networks are not scale-free networks and are characterized by a non-hierarchical topology and decentralized structure.
The small world characteristic of those networks allows for efficient communication within the bee colony.
The frequency a bee is observed inside the hive drops with increasing age.
That directly relates to the bees position in the colony network.
The detected communities relate to age-based functional groups with a spatial fidelity towards different regions of the comb. Those regions relate to the distinct type of cells and therefore to distinct tasks bees allocate.
Individual bees dynamically change functional groups as they age.

The non-hierarchical global network structure of the honey bee colony is stable over time, but its local structure is highly dynamic as individual bees change communities as they age. Those findings are aligned with previous research results and directly relate to the absence of a central authority and the decentralized organization of honey bee colonies shaped by temporal polyethism.

These network analysis results verify the definition of interaction networks by the initially chosen set of parameters and the functionality of the network pipeline in general.
The network pipeline is suitable, and it provides an excellent foundation for further investigations.

\section{Limitations}
regarding my methods, concerning implementation\\
dataset: quality, kind of a bit complex preprocessing (syncing cameras, removing invalid data, confidence), but still dead bess and almost dead bees in network\\
definition of interaction - minimum contact duration maybe was not the best idea\\
type of network spatial proximity (only proxy for interaction, no real interaction) -> maybe better contact (angle of bees similar to Mersch)/food-exchange network (interaction events), too much noise in the data\\


age distribution has some gaps (tagging not on weekends)-> not sure about it effects\\
context, missing domain knowledge, working in an interdisziplinary teams\\

\section{Future Work}
(1) recommendations for further studies, (2) recommendation for change\\
each recommendation should directly trace a direct conclusion\\

investigate: correlation of density and time, upper bound? or 100\% density after some X frames?\\
are communities robust regarding pipeline parameters maximum distance, minimum contact duration, window size (yes they are, tested for some values, but not systhematically)\\
pipelie parameters (maximum distance, minimum contact duration, window size) effects on network properties (degree, strength,lcc, edgeweights) ... tested but not systematically only some values and only window size up to one hour, should be done more systematically\\
compare the networks to random geometric graph~\cite{rgg2002} and model a walking bee as a random walker\\
so far nodes are attributed with only age and detection frequency, add other stuff, e.g. average speed, total distance traveled\\
compute centrality measures per community\\
weighted edges, should also inpect weighted versions of node measures (this was a bit to complicated, already implemented weighted version in networkX and igraoh do favour weights over number of hops, should look at~\textcite{opsahl2010node}, but depending on what you want to investigate you have to choose the $\alpha$)\\
compare analysis results to NON artifical bees networks\\
investigate different granularities (size of time window)\\
study longer time period not only 5 days\\
normalized edge weight (SRI - Simple Ratio Index, SRI measures
the proportion of times two individuals were seen
together out of the total number of times those individ-
uals were observed, by \textcite{croft2008exploring}) or normalized degree and stuff by frequency of detection\\
apply network reduction algorithm to reduce density and noise, by applying (no simple edge thresholding), disparity filter~\textcite{serrano2009extracting}

\vspace{2cm}
more data does not mean better analysis, one have to ask good questions, develop specialized hypothesis, a lot of options\\
explorative analysis approach difficult with data from animals I do not know, maybe easier with 'human' data (missing domain data)\\
alienation: automatic tracking -> no relation to the data or how the data was collected or animals\\
just applying network method to new research fields, sometimes just replicates known facts, Ending with: Zitat Krause (Buch)
