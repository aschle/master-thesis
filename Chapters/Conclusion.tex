\section{Discussion}

\section{Limitation}
contact duration and contact frequency\\
distances is are hard to measure, because hive is very small and dense (is spatial proximity a good proxy in this case)\\

\section{Summary}

\section{Future Work}

Measuring the robustness of network community structure using assortativity~\cite{shizuka2016measuring}
