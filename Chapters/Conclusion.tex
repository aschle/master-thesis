inferred time-aggregated networks out of high resolution tracking data of one honey bee colony\\
weighted undirected spatial proximity networks at three consecutive timesteps over a period of five days\\
analysis regarding network topology, community structures and development of community members\\

the small world characteristic allows for efficient communication within the bee colony\\
it is not a scale-free networks, as opposed to other real-wordl networks\\
the topology of the network is non-hierarchical, therefor no central bees in the sense of degree, strength, and centrality measure like closeness and betweenness exists\\
older bees are generally less detected than younger bees\\
position in the network also depends on the age\\
detected communities relate to age based groups with a spatial fidality towards regions of the comb, explanation: temporal polyethism\\
also bees move to older functional groups as they age\\


stable global non-hierarchical structure of the colony over time (topology, distribution of measures, communities)\\
but dynamic local structure nodes/bees change communities as they age\\
is aligned with previous studies and confirms research results of others (no central authority, dezentralized, temporal polyethism)\\


verifies my definition of the networks and the network pipeline with the chosen network parameters (maximal distance and minimum contact duration)\\
therefore analysis results validate the first goal: inferrence of time-aggregated networks seems to be ok\\
network pipeline is suitable for further research, good foundation, maybe with some modifications, depending on the aimed goals, fine tuning\\


\section{Limitations}
regarding my methods, concerning implementation\\
dataset: quality, kind of a bit complex preprocessing (syncing cameras, removing invalid data, confidence), but still dead bess and almost dead bees in network\\
definition of interaction - minimum contact duration maybe was not the best idea\\
type of network spatial proximity (only proxy for interaction, no real interaction) -> maybe better contact (angle of bees similar to Mersch)/food-exchange network (interaction events), too much noise in the data\\


age distribution has some gaps (tagging not on weekends)-> not sure about it effects\\
context, missing domain knowledge, working in an interdisziplinary teams\\

\section{Future Work}
(1) recommendations for further studies, (2) recommendation for change\\
each recommendation should directly trace a direct conclusion\\

investigate: correlation of density and time, upper bound? or 100\% density after some X frames?\\
are communities robust regarding pipeline parameters maximum distance, minimum contact duration, window size (yes they are, tested for some values, but not systhematically)\\
pipelie parameters (maximum distance, minimum contact duration, window size) effects on network properties (degree, strength,lcc, edgeweights) ... tested but not systematically only some values and only window size up to one hour, should be done more systematically\\
compare the networks to random geometric graph~\cite{rgg2002} and model a walking bee as a random walker\\
so far nodes are attributed with only age and detection frequency, add other stuff, e.g. average speed, total distance traveled\\
compute centrality measures per community\\
weighted edges, should also inpect weighted versions of node measures (this was a bit to complicated, already implemented weighted version in networkX and igraoh do favour weights over number of hops, should look at~\textcite{opsahl2010node}, but depending on what you want to investigate you have to choose the $\alpha$)\\
compare analysis results to NON artifical bees networks\\
investigate different granularities (size of time window)\\
study longer time period not only 5 days\\
normalized edge weight (SRI - Simple Ratio Index, SRI measures
the proportion of times two individuals were seen
together out of the total number of times those individ-
uals were observed, by \textcite{croft2008exploring}) or normalized degree and stuff by frequency of detection\\
apply network reduction algorithm to reduce density and noise, by applying (no simple edge thresholding), disparity filter~\textcite{serrano2009extracting}

\vspace{2cm}
more data does not mean better analysis, one have to ask good questions, develop specialized hypothesis, a lot of options\\
explorative analysis approach difficult with data from animals I do not know, maybe easier with 'human' data (missing domain data)\\
alienation: automatic tracking -> no relation to the data or how the data was collected or animals\\
just applying network method to new research fields, sometimes just replicates known facts, Ending with: Zitat Krause (Buch)
