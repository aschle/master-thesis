\section{Implementation, Runtime and Complexity}
For implementing the network pipeline python, with pandas and numpy, are used, because the bb\_binary library, for accessing the tracking, data is only available in python. The networks, in graphML format, are created using the python library \emph{NetworkX}\footnote{\url{https://networkx.github.io/} ; Last accessed: 2017-02-17, 08:07PM} in version 1.11.
iGraph for community detection\\
some bash scrips for generating multiple networks\\

bottleneck is reading bb\_binary data into pandas dataframes\\
using multithreading for distribution on frame level (a process gets X frames for processing)\\

maybe some table with how long nees what with how many cores (hom much RAM and so on)\\
