\section{Implementation, Runtime and Complexity}
For implementing the network pipeline python, with pandas and numpy, are used, because the bb\_binary library, for accessing the tracking, data is only available in python. The networks, in graphML format, are created using the python library \emph{NetworkX}\footnote{\url{https://networkx.github.io/} ; Last accessed: 2017-02-17, 08:07PM} in version 1.11.
I used iGraph for community detection. Some bash scrips for generating multiple networks.

Bottleneck is reading bb\_binary data into pandas dataframes.
i used the multithreading for distributing the data an alevel of 5 minutes (a process the frames coresponding to 5 minutes).

Maybe some table with how long what step needs, with how many cores (hom much RAM and so on).
