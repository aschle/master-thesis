\subsection{Summary and Results}
[TODO]\\

Networks in general, yes but\\
complex preprocessing of the data essential\\
confidence: reduce amount of data\\
hight confidence: less data, a bit better quality, but more gaps\\
low confidence: a lot of data, bad quality but less gaps\\
stitching cameras: remove duplicates\\
syncronize cameras\\
pre filter detections by ids, whos detection frequency is low\\

Temporal networks, yes but\\
time--aggregated\\
daily networks, because biological useful, other window would be random\\
due to maintainance and technical, camera failures: no period without interruptions\\


My goal, as mentioned in~\ref{sec:intro:goals}, was to answer the question whether it is possible to infer temporal networks with the provided honey bee tracking data and to work out challenges and limitations regarding the provided data set.

What pipeline parameters are necessary?
