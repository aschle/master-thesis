\subsection{Summary and Results}
[TODO]\\

Networks in general, yes but\\
complex preprocessing of the data essential\\
confidence: reduce amount of data\\
hight confidence: less data, a bit better quality, but more gaps\\
low confidence: a lot of data, bad quality but less gaps\\
stitching cameras: remove duplicates\\
syncronize cameras\\
pre filter detections by ids, whos detection frequency is low\\

Temporal networks, yes but\\
time--aggregated\\
daily networks, because biological useful, other window would be random\\
due to maintainance and technical, camera failures: no period without interruptions\\
