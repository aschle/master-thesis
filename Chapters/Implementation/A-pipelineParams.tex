\subsection{Specifying the Network and its Parameters}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As this work constitues the first step towards network analysis using this tracking data I chose to infer time-aggregated spatial proximity network. The Accordingly, the interactions are undirected but weighted.
A node in the network is a bee, identified by an ID.
The network consists only of bees that interact with other bees at least once, during the specified time interval.\\
Two bees are associated (spatially close to each other), if their distance is smaller than a \emph{maximum distance}.
Using only this criterion leads to many interactions, resulting in a very dense network because an interaction could only last for 0.33 seconds.
Therefore, an additional parameter the \emph{minimum contact duration} is introduced.
It specifies the minimum time two bees have to spend close to each other to be called associated.

Edges are assigned two attributes.
The first one is the frequency of contacts, meaning how often they share a close position. The second parameter refers to the total duration of contact, so the total time they spend nearby.

\subsubsection{Pipeline Parameters}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The network pipeline takes two types of parameters: one for specifying the resulting network and how spacial proximity is defined and one relates to the data set.

\begin{description}
\item[Maximum distance] level of closeness between to individual bees~(in pixel)
\item[Minimum contact duration] the number of frames two individuals need to spend close by in order to count it as an interaction~(in frames)
\item [Start timestamp] starting point of the network aggregation~(as UTC string)
\item [Window size] size of time window for aggregating the network~(in minutes)

\vspace{5mm}

\item[Confidence] level of confidence, as described in section~\nameref{subsec:confidence}~(in percent)
\item[Valid IDs] list of valid ids within a specified time interval, as described in section~\nameref{subsubsec:dataset:filter}~(in csv file format)
\item[Gap Size] this is used to corect the time series of bee pairs~(in frames)
\item[Number of CPUs] number of used CPUs for parallelization
\item[Year] calculate bee IDs and stitching of camera images according to the observation period~(2015 or 2016)
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Chosen Parameter Values for Network Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{Tables/chosenParams.tex}

For further network analysis, I chose three days: 20., 22., and 24. August.
Those days were chosen because a wide range of age groups was present at this time. The hive especially contained older bees which are likely to be foragers. Besides, no data is missing on those days.

The values are chosen according to biological constraints and similar to other studies, for better comparability.
I chose the length of a bee body, according to \textcite{baracchi2014socio}, as the maximum distance between two bees (figure~\ref{fig:contactRadius}). The average bee length of $212$px ($\pm 16$px)  was determinded by manually measuring the length of all bees ($n=337$) of four camera images using the tool ImageJ\footnote{\url{http://imagej.net/Welcome}; Last accessed:
 22.02.2016}.
The minimum contact duration is set to three frames (one second). This corresponds to~\textcite{mersch2013tracking}, they as also exclude interactions below one second.
To keep about 50\% of the data the confidence is set to $95\%$.
The gap size is set to two frames. This value corresponds to the median gap length in the time series of pairs.
