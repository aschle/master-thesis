\subsection{Describing the Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The dataset derives from high-resolution video files that capture tagged honey bees of one colony in a single frame observation hive.
The bees are uniquely tagged with circular 12-bit markers (figure~\ref{fig:markers}, section~\ref{ch:intro}).
Two cameras per side filmed the complete honeycomb permanently.
Figure~\ref{fig:obssetup} illustrates the camera setup.
The \emph{recording period} lasted nine weeks (63 days), from 19.07.2016 until 19.09.2016, with some interruptions due to maintenance work and technical failures. An overview about the complete recording period is given in figure~\ref{fig:observation-period} in appendix~\ref{ch:appendix}.

All four cameras, each with a resolution of $4000\times3000$ pixel, record $3.5$ frames per second. 
An image analysis pipeline~\cite{wario2015automatic} detects all bees in each frame.
The resulting detection data is stored in a binary file format.
A python library\footnote{The library is called \texttt{bb-binary} and is created by the Biorobotics Lab. It can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/BioroboticsLab/bb_binary}; Last accessed: 2106-02-16, 04:28PM} provides a frame-level access to those binary files.
The size of the dataset is $470$~GB, about $7.5$~GB of binary data per day.

\end{figure}

The 67 days long \emph{tagging period} started on 28.06.2016 and lasted until 02.09.2016, resulting in $3.191$ tagged bees. The young bees, which were raised in a separate incubator, were tagged and then added to the observation hive, about noon each day.
Figure~\ref{fig:tagging-period} (Appendix~\ref{ch:appendix}) shows the frequency of tagged bees per day. The hatching day for each bee is documented; therefore the age of each bee at a particular point in time can be calculated.
The life expectancy of a honey bee during summer ranges from 30 to 60 days, according to \textcite[p. 27]{menzel2016intelligenz}
Hence, the maximum number of present bees in the hive is about $1,600$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{table}[!t]
\colorbox{usethiscolorhere}{
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} r Y @{}}
	\textbf{Frame container} &
	Contains all frames, which belong to a specific video file of a certain camera.\\
	\textbf{Frame} &
	Includes all detections of one frame at a certain point in time.\\
	\textbf{Detection} &
	Detection of a bee at a certain point in time.\\
	\textbf{Decoded ID} &
	Identifier of a bee consisting of 12 probability values, representing 12 bits.\\
	\textbf{Confidence} &
	Value between 0\% and 100\%.\\
	\textbf{ID} &
	Decimal representation of a decoded ID.\\
	\textbf{Bee time series} & Binary sequence, indicating the absence and presence of a certain bee in a particular time interval.\\
	\textbf{Pair time series} & Binary sequence, indicating whether or not two bees are close to each other, in a particular time interval.\\
\end{tabularx}
}
\end{table}

The data is organized in so-called \emph{frame containers}.
Each frame container corresponds to one video file of a certain camera and consists of about $1024$ frames.
Each \emph{frame} holds a list of bees, which were detected by the image analysis pipeline.

A bee \emph{detection} has, among others, the following attributes:

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\textbf{xpos}: & $x$ coordinate of bee with respect to the image in pixel \\
\textbf{ypos}: & $y$ coordinate of bee with respect to the image in pixel \\
\textbf{decoded ID}: & decoded 12-bit ID \\
\textbf{cam ID}: & ID of the camera ${0,1,2,3}$ \\
\textbf{timestamp}: & unix timestamp with milliseconds\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The data can be accessed by iterating on the frame level, using a start and end time\-stamp for specifying a time interval.

\end{figure}

\footnotetext{Data set: 26.07.2016, 4~p.~m., 10~minutes, all cameras}

Twelve bits can encode the identity of 4096 bees.
Each bit of the decoded ID is not a one or zero but represents a probability between $0$ and $255$, normalized to a value between $0$ and $1$.
Therefore, a bit indicates the confidence of the image analysis pipeline for that specific bit.
I define the confidence $c$ for a bit $b$, analogously to Leon~\textcite[p.~14]{leon2016}, as $c(b)=2\cdot|b-0.5|$.
The confidence of a decoded ID is, accordingly, the minimum of all twelve bits' confidences.
Detections with a confidence below a certain level are removed from the data set.
Consequently, a high level of confidence reduces the amount of data, which remains for further processing.

I use the age information of the bees to check the quality of the remaining data.
A bee has a negative age, if the pipeline detected a code, that was not used yet.
I examined the number of remaining bee detections and IDs, depending on the chosen confidence by calculating the age of each bee detection and ID.
A bee detection with a negative age is counted as an \emph{invalid detection}. Also, an ID with a negative age is counted as an \emph{invalid ID}.

As expected, with increasing confidence, the number of remaining detections and IDs decreases (figure~\ref{fig:remainingVSquality}), as well as the fraction of invalid detections and IDs.
With a confidence level of 100\%, the fraction of invalid detections reaches the value of 2.5\%. However, the fraction of invalid IDs stays at the high value of 30.2\%. Consequently, selecting a high level of confidence is not sufficient for obtaining a high data quality.
Therefore, to obtain a more reliable dataset, invalid detections need to be filtered out, in addition to choosing a good level of confidence.

\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Data set: 20.08.2016, 24 hours, number of total frames: 302400}

A good indicator, whether a bee detection represents a real bee on the comb is its detection frequency.
The hypothesis is:
Individuals with a very low detection rate seem to be detection errors and lead to the assumption that those bees do not exist.
To check this hypothesis, I investigate the correlation between the detection frequency of bees and their age.
Figure~\ref{fig:filter} shows that bees with a negative age are on average less detected than bees with a positive age.

During my analysis, I noticed the existence of bees with a high detection frequency attributed with a negative age. I inspected the corresponding photos and confirmed that those bee detections correspond to living individuals and are no artifacts. Probably this result from a mistake in the table, which reports the hatching days for each bee.
Consequently, I excluded bees from this analysis, which had a negative age, but a detection frequency over 10,000 frames. Also I excluded bees~($n=10$), whose age is unknown\footnote{id= [2,
    74,
    2045,
    3172,
    3764,
    3796,
    3827,
    3836,
    3844,
    3940]}.
For each analysis day, the number of detections per ID is calculated, excluding the mentioned IDs.
To obtain a reliable dataset, I filtered invalid detections, by discarding all detections with an ID frequency below the 99th percentile of negative IDs.

\subsubsection{Time Series of Bees and Bee Pairs}
\label{subsec:tracking}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I investigated the quality of the initial data regarding its completeness of bee tracks. A bee tracks represent the movement of an individual over time. I transformed the initial data set into binary \emph{bee time series}, depicted in figure~\ref{fig:structure} left and middle.
A bee time series, similar to a track, represents the absence and presence of a bee over a specified sequence of frames.
For further processing I use the bee time series to extract \emph{pair time series} of bees that are spatially close (figure~\ref{fig:structure}, right).
A one indicates that a pair of bees is detected and both bees are spatially close in a certain frame.


By analyzing the resulting pair time series, I noticed that the sequences of ones are often interrupted by short sequences of zeroes.
As stated before, the higher the level of confidence, the more data is discarded. This data reduction leads consequently to more zeroes in both time series.
I assume that those short gaps do not refer to any meaningful behavior of the bees. Bees are not able to approach each other and move apart within a second because they simply do not move that fast.
Therefore I concluded, that those gaps originate from detection errors and consequently need to be treated in an appropriate way during further data processing.
