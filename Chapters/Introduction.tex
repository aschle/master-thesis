\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

Complex insect societies are formed by thousands of individuals, which continously move and interact inside a dark nest. Honey bee colonies are thus organized complex social systems, which form a collective intelligence. Observing individual honey bees is therefore vital for understanding collective behavior, decision making and organisation of task within the colony.

The Biorobotics Lab of Freie Universit√§t Berlin developed technologies to track all individuals of a complete honey bee (apis mellifera) colony. Conventional approaches usually focus on a small subset of the hive life, whether this regards time, space, or animal identity~\cite{wario2015automatic}[TODO: change sentence]. All individuals of a colony have been marked on their thorax using circular tags (figure~\ref{fig:markers}). Spatial information for each bee is then recorded for a peroid of nine weeks.

\section{Motivation}

Most of the studies analysing behaviour of insects colonies only use a small amount of individually labeled animals, a short observation period, and usually manually detect interaction between animals looking at the videos. data~\cite{quevillon2015social}[TODO: more references]. Here it is done in a more inclusive way, all animals, long term observation, automatic detection of individuals.

\section{Research Goal}

The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether the provided data set of tracked honey bees is useful for creating worker-worker interaction networks using spatial proximity as a proxy for interactions between bees. Thus, I need to implement a pipeline to infer networks out of the data set. Furthermore I want to find out if the resulting networks are suitable for social network analysis.

I want to achive my research goal by answering the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Is it possible to infer networks with the provided data set?}\\
What challenges and limitations does the data set imply?
\item \emph{What kind of networks emerge and what are their properties?}\\
How are those networks characterized in and are they different from a random network?
\item \emph{Do community structures exists?}\\
Are those communities robust?
\item \emph{How are those communities characterized?}\\
Do they reflect known colony behaviour in terms of age and spatial distribution?
\item \emph{How do the communities evolve over time?}\\
Are they stabel over time and how do members change communities over time?

\end{enumerate}
